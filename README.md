#########PART2 Problem 4##########

=====Exercise 1=====

  -----Question 1-----
  
Please see "Exercise 1.xls" 
  I set 4 number of groups. Group 1 names "bar-tight spiral" which includes 9 Galaxies，they are field 122 352 359 356 198 196 432 244 and 243；Group 2 names "oval ball" which includes 3 Galaxies,they are field 331 216 215；Group 3 names "spheric" which includes only one Galaxies field 230；The last group is special ,strange,does not belong to any other 3 groups, which includes only one Galaxies field 319.¶
  
  -----Question 2-----
  
They all have a bright core with halo or spiral around it ,diffrent shape can be distinguished by ellipticity.

=====Exercise 2======

  Ellipticals：E7(122,216,331,215) E0(230right); Spirals:Sc(11) SBa(122) Sb(196,319,352) Sc(198,243,244,356,432) S0(230left) S0(359)

=====Exercise 3=====

Please see the "notebook.csv" 
  15 galaxies of Abell 2255,both spirals and ellipticals, and they are saved them in your notebook. They have almost the same redshift z~0.08,but different in shape,spirals or ellipticals.
